    # CRUD stands for the four basic operations you can perform on data: create, read, update and delete)
    # resources :notes automatically creates 7 RESTful routes for notes.

    # REST is an architectural style for designing web apps. The 7 RESTful routes are:
    # GET - /journal/notes | notes#index | List all notes (notes dashboard)
    # GET - /journal/notes/new | notes#new | Show new note form
    # POST - /journal/notes	notes#create | Create a note
    # GET - /journal/notes/:id | notes#show | Show a single note
    # GET - /journal/notes/:id/edit | notes#edit | Edit form for a note
    # PATCH/PUT - /journal/notes/:id | notes#update | Update a note
    # DELETE - /journal/notes/:id | notes#destroy | Delete a note
  end
end
