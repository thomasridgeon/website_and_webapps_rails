  # attr_reader is a shortcut for creating getter methods- methods that allow you to read the value of instance variables from outside the class. 
  # This makes these instance varibales above readable from outside the class. So this would make me able to do things like tdee.weight or tdee.age

    # the parameters weight, height, age, sex and activity_level are temporary local variables available only inside the initialize method. By assigning them to instance variables (with an @), I am saying "store these values inside the object, so they are abailable to all other methods in the object"
