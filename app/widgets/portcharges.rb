  def initialize(result = nil)
    # def initialize(result = nil): This line defines the initialize method, which is the class constructor in Ruby. It accepts one parameter, result, and the = nil part makes this parameter optional. When a page object is created without a result (e.g., on the initial /portcharges page load), result is set to nil. When a new page object is created after a calculation, the total charge is passed as the result.
    super ({})
    # super: The super keyword calls the initialize method of the parent class, which is Erector::Widget. This is a crucial step that ensures the parent class is properly set up before the subclass code runs.
    # super({}). This passes an empty hash to the parent class
    @result = result
    # @result = result: This line assigns the value of the result parameter to an instance variable named @result. An instance variable is a variable that belongs to a specific instance of the class, making its value available to all other methods within that instance, such as the content method that renders the HTML.
    # The @ symbol in front of a variable name in Ruby signifies that it's an instance variable. Think of a class as a blueprint for a house and an instance of that class as a specific house built from that blueprint.
    # result (without the @): This is a local variable. It only exists inside the initialize method. Once the initialize method finishes its job, this variable disappears.
    # @result (with the @): This is an instance variable. It becomes a part of the specific PortChargesCalculatorPage object you've created. This variable will persist for the entire life of that object and can be accessed by any other method within that same object.
    # The initialize method is where the result from the calculation is first received. By assigning it to the instance variable @result, you are effectively saving that value to the "house" so that other "rooms" (methods) in the "house" can use it.
